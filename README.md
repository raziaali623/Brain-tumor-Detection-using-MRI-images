# Brain-tumor-Detection-using-MRI-images

This project is in its initial stages, so we havent added all images.
Currently it is only detecting whether the tumor is present in the MRI Image or No
In future we will enhance it to diagnose whether the tumor is malignant or benign. 
We are also developing a web interface for uploading image and managing users and data.

The test folder has images for testing,  the training folder has images for training
The output images  are labeled with y if the image is a tumor and n otherwise (these are inside folder Br35H-Mask-RCNN)
The yes folder has the original images with positive tumor and the no folder has negative tumor images
The jupyter notebook is named : notebooks_Tumordetection.ipynb

We are still trying and testing....
