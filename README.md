# Brain-tumor-Detection-using-MRI-images
This project is in its initial stages, so we havent added all images.
Currently it is only detecting whther the tumor is present in the MRI Image or No
In future we will enance it to diagnose whether is malignant or benign. e are also
developing a web interface for uploading image and dmanaging users and data.
We are still trying and testing....
the test folder has images for testing,  the training folder has images for training
the output images  are labeled with y if the image is a tumor and n otherwise (these are inside folder Br35H-Mask-RCNN)
the yes folder has the original images with positive tumor and the no folder has negative tumor images
the jupyter notebook is named : notebooks_Tumordetection.ipynb
